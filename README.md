# Human Activity Recognition Dissertation

This repository contains the implementation and findings from my Master's dissertation project titled **"Unlocking the Power of Data Augmentation Techniques Using Human Activity Recognition"**. The project focuses on applying traditional and advanced data augmentation techniques (including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC)) to improve the performance of deep learning models in **Human Activity Recognition (HAR)**.

The repository includes the code, data, and results associated with the dissertation, providing a comprehensive guide to the methods and experiments used to augment the dataset and evaluate machine learning and deep learning models.

## Project Overview

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a field that involves classifying human activities based on sensor data. This project explores the application of **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** and **Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC)** for augmenting the data used in HAR tasks to improve model performance. The dataset used in this dissertation is derived from multiple human activity datasets including **UCI-HAR**, **Opportunity**, and **PAMAP2**.

## Research Objectives

The primary goal of this dissertation is to:

- Investigate the impact of **data augmentation techniques** (such as rotation, scaling, GANs, and CPC) on the performance of models used for HAR.
- Compare the performance of **machine learning models (SVM)** and **deep learning models (LSTM)** when trained on augmented data.
- Visualize the results of experiments using **confusion matrices** and evaluate performance with metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.

## Installation
